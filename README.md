# Owls of Bavaria

This is a web mapping application to display owl sightings in Bavaria using data from iNaturalist.

This project is still in progress and it not production ready yet.

## About

This web mapping application is being built in honor of my mother who enjoys birding and is really into owls. The application takes owl observation data from iNaturalist and displays it on a map. The observations generally come with images and the names of the owl species and zooming in on the location allows birders to see, where owl observations are being made in their area. It is also intended to motivate users to go out and make their own animal observations which they can then add to iNaturalist where is can be used by scientists. Future additions will come with more information about the owls, options to filter by dates and species, and possibly the option to sign in to iNaturalist directly and add contributions.
